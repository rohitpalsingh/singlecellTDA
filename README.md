The Focus of the repository is to do the following before performing Downstream Analysis.
# Data Pre-Processing
1.  Feature Selection
2.  Dimensionality Reduction
3.  Data Visualization
# Down Stream Analysis
1.  Cell Group Annotation
2.  Identifying Infered Trejectories through topomap/mapper/tomato. Identify Major Topological Change during different time course.
3.  Identify key genes driver genes for the differentiation.
4.  Analysising different interesting areas in Single Cell Genomics. Perturbations between treated/condition/simulated and untreated/control/unsimulated samples.
