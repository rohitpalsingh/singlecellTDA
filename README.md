The Focus of the repository is to do the following before performing Downstream Analysis.
1.  Feature Selection
2.  Dimensionality Reduction
3.  Clustering
4.  Cell Group Annotation
5.  Identifying Infered Trejectories through topomap/mapper/tomato. Identify Major Topological Change during diffrent time course.
6.  Identify key genes driver genes for the differentiation.
7.  Analysising different interesting areas in Single Cell Genomics. Perturbations between treated/condition/simulated and untreated/control/unsimulated samples.
